# Earthquake Visualizer

A web application that visualizes earthquake data on a map, allowing users to filter earthquakes by magnitude and view insights based on recent earthquake data. This project uses React, Leaflet for mapping, and the OpenAI API for generating insights about earthquake patterns.

## Features

- **Interactive Map**: Displays earthquake locations with markers of varying sizes based on the earthquake's magnitude.
- **Filter by Magnitude**: Use a slider to filter the earthquakes based on their magnitude.
- **Generate Insights**: Generate a summary of recent earthquake data using OpenAI's GPT model to provide valuable insights.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **Leaflet**: JavaScript library for interactive maps.
- **Axios**: HTTP client for making API requests.
- **OpenAI API**: Used for generating earthquake data insights.
- **Tailwind CSS (optional)**: For styling the application.
